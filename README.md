What technology can do for blind and Visually impaired people who are less fortunate than us? Can we leverage the Mobile phone technology to give a helping hand to them? Drishti is first step towards this dream... Its not about vision of few technology guys... Its a necessity of a large mob of visually challenged people around us.. Come, let us join together to make it possible them to read using their Smart phones... Sounds interesting? hah? Yes, indeed!!!
